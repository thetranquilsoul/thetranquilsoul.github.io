            <p>Hey. Addie.. Things have been difficult lately. And I know I messed up big time. I wanted to write to you this tonight because my heart doesn't want to let our connection go easily. It retries retries and retries, again and again.

Addie, I don't want us to be distant. But if you want, you can take a break.. I mean, I am ready for any decision you wish to take, A.. I would accept it. Yes, it would take a while for me to process it but it's okay. I am ready to bear anything of this outcome of what I have done overthinking.. I deserve this Adeeti.. You became my favourite person in just a few days. You visited Chandrapura and we spent so much time together. This new year, I wish all the very best for you.

Addie.. I am not asking for your forgiveness. And I know I don't deserve it now.. I just want you to know, that itna sabkuch karke bhi, I am not happy. I put an axe on my own foot. Hard. Its you right now or nobody else. You became my best friend Addie... Office bhi jaata hu to I just get carried away by my work and I keep silent. Kisi cheez me mann ni lag rha. Its so tough for me. My heart is shattered.. I always find myself not paying attention sometimes and I get zoned out. What I did, is not forgivable... I hurt you.

Addie, you can send me as many cold snaps and texts you want Adeeti.. It's okay. I'll just take it silently. I won't do anything related to guilt trip manipulation.. I am so sorry Adeeti.. That day, After I came back to my room where I was alone, I was dying to talk to you. Kuch samajh nhi aaya to I sent you a voice message on snap. Sorry for that drama.. Sorry that I was being dramatic on those notes I tried hard to keep myself composed.. It kills me every day every moment to think that we are not same anymore. 

Adeeti... I will wait for it. If you would reconsider it, I promise I will protect our bond at all costs..! Because all this made me realize how important you are to me.... I promise on my whole life I will never ever do such things again.

A, I won't ever disturb you again after this with my beggings and sorries... I deserve this. But if you consider it I would be much happier and never ever let you go like ever!!!.. Please? Mujhe maaf kardo?.. I can't just give up on us. Mujhse nahi hoga bas. It was me. Just me. Mujhe jitna kehna hai kehlo Adeeti. But please, Mujhe maaf krdo?...
I made this site bohat dil laga kr.. I guess this is my Love language. I spent all day today to develop this for you my Dear Addie..

                *joins my hands..on my knees*
                
Whatever your decision is, I will accept it silently and happily.... because Addie,

You mean a lot to me. A lot...

Sorry.. I Love You...
